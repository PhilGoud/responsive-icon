# responsive-icon
Sick of responsive-representing logos with an iPhone and iPad home button and/or bezels like it it 2007 ? 
You don't want an iMac to represent the desktop ? There, I fixed it for you. 
Enjoy.


There is a minimalistic version and a notch version (based on a random chinese Android phone. I don't remember which)

It shows a webapp (PWA versions) or a website, depending on your needs.
