# responsive-icon

Do you want to reprent the concept of being responsive or multiplatform ?

Are you sick of icons displaying an iPhone and iPad with a home button and/or bezels like it it 2007 ? 
You don't want an iMac to represent the desktop ? 

There, I fixed it for you. 
Enjoy.

Inspired by the one found here : https://www.orangekeymarketing.co.uk/web-design-middlesbrough/responsive-icon/

There is a minimalistic version and a notch version (based on a random chinese Android phone. I don't remember which)

It shows a webapp (PWA versions) or a website, depending on your needs.
